# Basic Solr Config #

The components in [basic-solr-config](https://github.com/utkdigitalinitiatives/basic-solr-config) are **not** pre-installed. The default configurations in islandora_vagrant differ slightly. The following notes point out how to use our localizations. 

## Testing ##

[Tests](modules/tests/...) rely on (need to work out how to get these extra branches into the upstream repository) the [4.x-vagrant branch](...) of the basic-solr-config. See [below] for details on file placement.
